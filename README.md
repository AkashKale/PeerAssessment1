# PeerAssessment1
I used the Week 2 application as reference and implemented my own idea based on it. The animation is created by drawing random sized buildings. The size of windows and clouds and number of windows are also randomized. Generation rate of the building and clouds depends on speed.
Thanks freesound.org/people/UncleSigmund/sounds/30149/ for the background music.
